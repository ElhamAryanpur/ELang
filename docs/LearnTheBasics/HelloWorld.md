The `Hello World` is a first program in any programming languages! Same goes to ELang as well!

If you have gone through [`setup`](https://github.com/ElhamAryanpur/ELang/blob/master/docs/LearnTheBasics/HowToSetup.md) successfuly, you should see a `config.yml` and a `compile.elpp` ready for the journey!

Open up the `compile.elpp` file and you will see a code already made similar to:

```
show Hello World!
```
This is the Hello World in ELang! Simple right?
Now let's just talk about what above code is made of!

Elang works with `keywords` and `arguments` just like command line languages. this was done for simplicity and speed. `Keywords` in ELang are first words in each line. `Arguments` is any word after the first line.

in case of that code above; `show` is the `keyword` and `Hello World!` is its arguments!
Different keywords take different style of arguments so beware of that!

Say you want to greet your friends, this would be how you change the code:
```
show Hello My Awesome Friends!
```

You will learn more on the syntax later in the Documentaion!

One last thing... The `show` keyword is one line showing. meaning if you have two `show`keywords in two lines, both will show on the screen on a new line!

example:
```
show Hello
show World!
```
will output:
```
Hello
World!
```
