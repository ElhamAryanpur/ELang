# Welcome To ELang repository!

## ABOUT
ELang is short for Electronic Language. It is a translator between human's and computer's languages! Currently supporing C++ for computers and English for humans.

## REQUIREMENTS
You would need a c++ compiler that is compatible with G++. I recommend g++ for linux and Mingw for windows.
Also as this is not pre compiled binary... you need python 3 too!
