Welcome To ELang repository!

# ABOUT
ELang is short for Electronic Language. It is a translator between human's and computer's languages! Currently supporing C++ for computers and English for humans.

# REQUIREMENTS
You would need a c++ compiler that is compatible with G++. I recommend g++ for linux and Mingw for windows.
Also as this is not pre compiled binary... you need python 3 too!

# USAGE
Documentaion on usage will be online soon. for now... please refer to [features.elpp]() for syntax example!

At first, please run the ELang compiler once for auto setting up configuration. You will see a config.yml file! change it as you please! Also make sure path to g++ is working!

For compiling your code, you need to make a file with extension of .elpp! then put it in same folder as ELang compiler and make sure you include it in the config.yml in FileName config. then run the ELang and you will see a file on the folder appearing! there you go... your first ELang code!
